# TechBlog

## About
This web application is a full stack tech blog. The frontend is built using HTML and CSS. The backend is built using MYSQL: a relational database used to store the blog data. A user can create an account and sign in to create their own blog post or comment on another blog post.

The most difficult parts of this project were creating the schema and connecting to the database and deploying to Heroku.
